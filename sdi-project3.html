<p>This is the story of a dreamer who could not wake up and dreamed everything he wanted to be in real life. I chose it because everyone wishes to be something greater than yourself.</p>
<p> Every function within my code tries to use the same global variables and avoid creating new ones. I used all the required elements in a flowchart to reflect my story. For example: In my story, there is a time when I record a full cd album and I have ten days to complete it. So I created a while loop to count days, and number of songs, and "console.log" my progress. Creating a flowchart along with your code may seem simple but it takes more time than you would think. </p>
